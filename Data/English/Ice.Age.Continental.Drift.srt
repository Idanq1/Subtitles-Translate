1
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:13,835
Goal!

2
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,678
What was that? Ellie, did you hear that?

3
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,219
I heard it, Manny.
Whatever it is, it's miles away.

4
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,720
Peaches, are you all right?

5
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,247
Where is she?

6
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,517
No teenager is ever up early.

7
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,790
Easy warden, she's not on lockdown.

8
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,869
You two were supposed to be
responsible uncles!

9
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:48,169
What? I didn't see Peaches sneak off
maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago.

10
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,402
Or that she went with Louis to the falls.

11
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,672
The falls? Where the delinquents go?

12
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,839
Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.

13
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,645
No, no, it's a gateway hangout.

14
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,413
First it's the falls,
then she's piercing her trunk...

15
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:02,682
and the next thing you know,
she's addicted to berries.

16
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:06,221
Manny! You are overreacting.

17
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,657
She's not going to be
your little girl forever.

18
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:11,991
I know. That's what worries me.

19
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:15,692
Come on!

20
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:19,630
Louis!

21
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:23,073
Would you get your head out of the ground
for once and try to have a little fun?

22
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:28,376
I'm a molehog.
My head's supposed to be underground.

23
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:32,680
And my idea of fun isn't risking death
so that you can meet some cute mammoth.

24
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,949
Ethan isn't cute. He's hot.

25
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:39,756
Besides, you can't spend your whole life
playing it safe.

26
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,487
- I know I would.
- Dad?

27
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,789
There's no reason to be mad.

28
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:46,694
You know how I feel
about you going to the falls.

29
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:47,960
Especially alone.

30
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,692
She's not alone, sir.

31
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,029
You don't count, Weiner.

32
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,638
Yes, there's my place,
and you just put me in it, thank you.

33
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,696
Come on, young lady.

34
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,136
We're going home
where I can keep an eye on you.

35
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:03,812
So, should I just wait here, or...

36
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,968
Yeah, you don't scare me, Mother Nature!

37
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:27,300
There's nothing you can throw at me
that I can't handle.

38
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,568
I think we're almost there!

39
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:35,306
We had better be! I just lost the steering.

40
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,188
Has anyone seen Precious?
It's her feeding time.

41
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,347
Mom! Granny's talking about
her dead pet again.

42
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,516
Hey, paws up, everybody!

43
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:51,359
Paws down, Uncle, please! That is nasty.

44
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,231
Be careful, Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody!

45
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,194
Bad kitty!

46
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,297
Rock!

47
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,516
Okay, so tell me, when exactly
will I be allowed to hang out with boys?

48
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,490
When I'm dead, plus three days.
Just to make sure I'm dead.

49
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,308
Manny, are you okay?

50
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,478
Get off... my face!

51
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,785
That was fun. Now, who should I eat first?

52
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,051
No, no, no!

53
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,730
Uncle Fungus! Could that really be you?

54
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,392
Sorry, sorry.

55
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,732
Mom, Dad!

56
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,495
Marshall!

57
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,698
- Hey!
- Granny?

58
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:09,172
This pumpkin's ripe for picking!

59
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:11,037
My whole familia.

60
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,202
See? He still hugs his parents.

61
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,513
I never thought I'd see
my little baby again.

62
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:18,248
We've been searching everywhere for you.

63
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:19,476
You have?

64
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:22,749
I knew it, I knew it!
Deep down, I knew I wasn't abandoned!

65
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:25,817
That's incorrect. We totally abandoned you.

66
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:30,591
But we always missed you. Right?

67
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,356
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:36,161
And we just knew Sid
would want to see his poor, dear Granny...

69
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:39,032
before her time is up.

70
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:42,368
I'll bury you all and dance on your graves.

71
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,599
So frail.

72
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,941
And she can't wait
to spend time with you, Sid.

73
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:50,514
Oh, yeah, Granny? Granny?

74
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,055
- Granny.
- I never get to have any fun.

75
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,692
Why don't you show her your cave?
Yeah, she could use a nap.

76
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,625
Boy, there's so much to tell you.

77
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,698
A lot has happened
since the last time I saw you.

78
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,128
Not interested.

79
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,769
But we fought dinosaurs in the lce Age.

80
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,098
It didn't make sense,
but it sure was exciting.

81
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,097
We got rid of the crazy bat! Let's go!

82
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,209
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just leave.

83
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,608
Sid will be crushed.

84
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,949
Sorry, cookie,
things are breaking apart back home.

85
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,450
So, we're headed inland.
And Granny is just dead weight.

86
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,383
- See you.
- Mush, mush!

87
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:34,593
And warn the community.
She tends to wander!

88
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,558
Well, that explains a lot about Sid.

89
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:41,096
Mom, Dad, do you have Granny's teeth?
She can't find them.

90
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:46,965
Hey! Can you chew this thing for me?

91
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,370
Guys? Where is everyone?

92
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,038
I'll handle this.

93
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,872
Sid?

94
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,409
Your family was wiped out by an asteroid.
Sorry.

95
00:08:58,585 --> 00:08:59,745
What?

96
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,411
What Diego is trying to say is...

97
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,423
they left.

98
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,823
They only wanted to find you
so you could take care of Granny.

99
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:13,591
Come on, what kind of sick family
would ditch their Granny on someone?

100
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,735
That's just crazy. That's just...

101
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,770
That's just...

102
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:21,034
...my family.

103
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,902
At least you still have Granny.
Right, buddy?

104
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,740
Yeah, Granny. Granny?

105
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:29,238
Granny?

106
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:32,113
Wow. For an old girl, she moves fast.

107
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,286
- Granny?
- Granny.

108
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:39,382
Granny?

109
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,858
Come out, come out wherever you are!

110
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:41,951
Come on, Granny.

111
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:46,431
Here, Granny, Granny.
I have prunes for you!

112
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,794
Just the way you like them!

113
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,629
I don't want to see that.

114
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,104
Oh, no.

115
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:00,378
What if your dad finds out?
I'm not as tough as I look!

116
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,480
Wait, do you hear that?

117
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,787
Go long!

118
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:16,920
Cool!

119
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:18,953
Hey, look, there's Ethan.

120
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,293
Yeah, Ethan!

121
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,695
You go, boy!

122
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,727
That was nice.

123
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:27,700
Yeah!

124
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,068
See? Fun, no danger.

125
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,242
Check me out!

126
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:45,852
- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not fine!

127
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,424
You did not just do that! That was crazy!

128
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:52,923
Nice.

129
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,364
Yeah!

130
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,593
Isn't he perfect?

131
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,231
"Perfect." lt's such a strong word.
Maybe "adequate."

132
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,365
Who are we stalking?

133
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:03,909
Is it Ethan? I bet it's Ethan.

134
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,604
- Hey, Weiner.
- What are you guys doing here?

135
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,111
Manny told us to keep an eye on you.

136
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,206
- But not to let you see us.
- Under any circumstances.

137
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,882
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

138
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:18,087
Okay, I'm going for it. Do I look okay?

139
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:19,448
Louis?

140
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,896
"Okay" doesn't even begin to cover it.

141
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:27,761
Louis. You're the greatest friend ever!

142
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:31,931
That's me.

143
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:35,370
Hi, Ethan, my name's Peaches.
What's yours?

144
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,910
What am I doing?
Okay, just be cool, just be...

145
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:43,372
No!

146
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,116
Yeah. That's intense!

147
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:51,483
This hurts so much!

148
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,757
No! No! No!

149
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,064
Gross. It's that weirdo
who chills with possums!

150
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:07,305
What just happened?

151
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, no! Ethan, I am so sorry.

152
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,640
Wow, you're even better-looking up close.

153
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,712
Phenomenal. I mean...

154
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:17,281
You have a twin sister?

155
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,145
Am I interrupting something?

156
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,050
- Dad!
- Oh, boy. Okay...

157
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,212
Sorry, if I just...

158
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,518
- Wait, no, you go left.
- Just move back a bit.

159
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,683
You! Keep away from my daughter.

160
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,556
- Dad...
- And you, you're grounded!

161
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,220
- But I didn't do...
- Grounded!

162
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,729
Loser alert.

163
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,593
Ouch, that's her dad.

164
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,996
Seriously, that's embarrassing.

165
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,093
What a freak.

166
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,268
Peaches!

167
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,177
Peaches, come on. Let's talk about this!

168
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,779
How could you embarrass me
in front of my friends?

169
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:52,076
You deliberately went
where you weren't supposed to!

170
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,809
You can't control my life!

171
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm trying to protect you!
That's what fathers do.

172
00:12:57,256 --> 00:13:00,316
Well... I wish you weren't my father.

173
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:04,820
She's just upset, honey.

174
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,195
Peaches! It's not the end of the world.

175
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,436
Whoa. Excuse me.

176
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,939
I don't think that was you.

177
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,648
- What was that?
- I don't know.

178
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,645
Stay there.

179
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,318
I'll come to you.

180
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,853
- Ellie!
- Manny!

181
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,197
No!

182
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,001
- Dad!
- Peaches, get back!

183
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,305
Hurry, Dad! Hurry!

184
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,404
Manny!

185
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,349
- Diego!
- You never would have made it!

186
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,327
Ellie, behind you!

187
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:14,659
What's happening?

188
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:22,571
Go to the land bridge!
You'll be safe on the other side.

189
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,002
No, Manny! No!

190
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,644
I'll meet you there!

191
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,018
Manny! No!

192
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:44,152
Ellie, you have to get out of here!
Go! Go now!

193
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,574
- Mom!
- Get back! Get back!

194
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,205
Daddy!

195
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,869
Stay alive!

196
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:36,947
No matter how long it
takes, I will find you!

197
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,449
Mom, this is all my fault.
If I had just listened...

198
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,986
Peaches! This is not your fault, okay?

199
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,420
What if I never see him again?
And the last thing we did was fight.

200
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:51,052
Hey, your father is the toughest,
most stubborn mammoth I've ever met.

201
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,222
He'll come back for us. That's a promise.

202
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,538
Come on!
Help me turn this thing around!

203
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:16,052
Everyone, please, settle down. Don't panic!

204
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,622
Wait, Mom, where's Louis?
We have to find him.

205
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,084
Okay, fast.

206
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,333
They need me! We got to get back.

207
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,897
Buddy, this thing's too big to turn.
The current's pulling us out.

208
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:40,207
You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise.

209
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,837
Was this before she abandoned you?

210
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,142
Yes, it was.

211
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,343
But the point being that,
even though things look bad...

212
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:48,977
there's a rainbow around every corner...

213
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:53,414
and nothing but smooth sailing ahead!

214
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,727
Smooth sailing, Sid?

215
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,234
- Louis? Louis?
- Louis?

216
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,377
Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!

217
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:15,480
Louis where are you?
Come on, we have to go.

218
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,644
Louis?

219
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,119
Peaches!

220
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,286
Louis, you have to jump.

221
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,520
No! Go, save yourselves.

222
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,292
We're not leaving without you.

223
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:34,355
Oh, thank goodness.

224
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,491
Jump!

225
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,540
This is why I travel underground.

226
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,580
Thanks for coming back.

227
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,586
What do you mean?
You don't leave a friend behind.

228
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,352
Great, let's go.

229
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,924
That wall is going to keep moving
and crush us.

230
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,152
We need to get to the land bridge.

231
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:04,386
Any questions?

232
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:06,822
Yes?

233
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:11,533
When you drink water through your trunk,
does it taste like boogers?

234
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,196
No.

235
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,638
Well, sometimes. Let's move!

236
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:32,022
Just keep your eye on the horizon.

237
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,559
I can't find the horizon.

238
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,033
Holy crab!

239
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:58,343
Hold me.

240
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:01,383
If I don't make it...

241
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:05,045
find me a wife, and tell her I love her.

242
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,992
We made it!

243
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,595
Come on, ocean,
is that the best you can do?

244
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,139
Am I right, buddy?

245
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:39,758
Hey, there really is a rainbow
around every corner!

246
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,266
Peaches!

247
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:06,241
You okay?

248
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,282
I'm just so worried about my dad.

249
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,183
Listen, we're going to get to him.

250
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,017
At this pace, we'll
stay ahead of the wall...

251
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,352
and we'll make it to the land bridge
before you know it.

252
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,958
We're all gonna survive this.

253
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:26,396
Okay, maybe they won't.
But everyone else, totally fine.

254
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,226
We're still heading away from home.

255
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,701
Yeah, but we survived,
and we still have each other.

256
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,202
Things could be worse, right?

257
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,135
For once, he's actually right.

258
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:02,537
We made it through storms
and tidal waves...

259
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:05,441
and a vicious assortment of seafood.

260
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,343
What more can they hit us with?

261
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,005
Trying to make me get up
if I don't want to get up.

262
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:11,106
If I want to get up I'd get up.

263
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,172
Hello?

264
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,176
What the...?

265
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:15,982
Dagnabbit, I'm trying to sleep!

266
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,645
Granny? You're alive!

267
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:20,417
And can we say
how thrilled we are to see you?

268
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,426
Hey, fats, you want to get me out of here?

269
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,591
Hey, come on.

270
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,393
Pretend I'm a dessert,
that should motivate you.

271
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:35,806
I can't believe this.
You slept through that storm?

272
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,809
I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorns.

273
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,444
Thanks for drawing my bath, Sidney.

274
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:44,981
- Granny, grab my paw.
- No way.

275
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:48,011
This is my first bath in decades.

276
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:51,681
There's your proof.

277
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:54,191
Quick! Somebody do something!

278
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:00,290
- I got you, Granny.
- Get off of me!

279
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:03,761
Granny!

280
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,330
What are you peeping toms all looking at?

281
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:13,300
A lady can't take a bath in peace?
Eyeballing me like a rump roast.

282
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,812
What's the life expectancy
for a female sloth?

283
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:19,750
She'll outlive us all, you know that, right?

284
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,480
Yeah, the spiteful ones live the longest.

285
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:38,252
How big is this ocean?

286
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:42,315
Water, water, everywhere

287
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,555
Nor any drop to drink

288
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:47,292
Well, except maybe that drop.

289
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:54,267
That's a little... salty.

290
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:58,500
Precious! Mommy's calling you.

291
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:01,544
Precious! Come here, sweetie.

292
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,772
Hey, lady, have you seen Precious?

293
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:06,383
If you mean the imaginary,
or perhaps deceased, pet...

294
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:10,080
that you keep searching for, no, I haven't.

295
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:11,279
Guys, look.

296
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:14,114
Where there's birds, there's land, right?

297
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:15,626
Hey, buddy, come here.

298
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,295
No, wait, wait! Come back.

299
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:22,528
Come back!

300
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,612
It's a huge bounty, mon capitaine.

301
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:40,445
Four passengers. Ripe for the taking.

302
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,055
One very smelly, and one very plump.

303
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,157
In my ocean?

304
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:48,987
What a terrible turn of events.

305
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:52,653
I love a terrible turn of events.

306
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:06,906
Am I hallucinating,
or is that ice coming straight towards us?

307
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,014
Yeah, yeah, it's coming.
It sounds like there's animals on it.

308
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:13,583
Yippee!
We're being rescued, we're being rescued!

309
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,016
I hear laughter.

310
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:17,248
Must be a party cruise.

311
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,071
Hey, they look fluffy.

312
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,149
I get the big woolly one.

313
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:51,287
Wow.

314
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,622
Get ready to slice and dice, boys.

315
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,284
- Knock it off, Squint.
- Hey!

316
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,759
Wait for Captain's orders.

317
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:00,922
Ahoy, down there!

318
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,865
How lucky are you?

319
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,130
You know these waters
are infested with pirates.

320
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,830
Right, boys?

321
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,032
Glad we found you before they did.

322
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:16,307
Captain Gutt, here to help.

323
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,879
You know, that's a nice monkey.

324
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:27,448
Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent.

325
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,686
The continent? That pile of rubble?

326
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,724
My family's there, so if you could just...

327
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:40,026
Your family? That is so sweet.

328
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:44,141
I hope you said goodbye,
because there's no way back.

329
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,642
Yes, there is.
Don't you remember, Captain?

330
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:51,180
You can sail to Switchback Cove
and catch the current back from there.

331
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,545
It's like a steel trap, this noggin is.

332
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,744
Thank you, Mister Flynn.

333
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,514
See? I knew there was a way home.

334
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,988
There is no home!

335
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,651
There is only here.

336
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,596
And here, your ship belongs to me.

337
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:11,263
Battle stations!

338
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,599
Fly the colors!

339
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:25,743
Now surrender your ship or face my fury.

340
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:27,476
Or face your furry what?

341
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:30,085
Not "furry." Fury!

342
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:31,688
Fire!

343
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,152
Hit the mammoth, win a prize.

344
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,356
Ding, ding, ding.

345
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:41,222
Fire the starboard cannons.

346
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,529
I love this job!

347
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:44,796
Shira, fetch.

348
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,235
Aye-aye, Captain.

349
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:52,102
You almost made it.

350
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:53,371
I don't fight girls.

351
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:58,373
I can see why.

352
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:00,876
Belly flop.

353
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:03,745
Sid!

354
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,847
Let's rumba, Tiny.

355
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:07,614
Lights out, big fella.

356
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:14,896
Manny!

357
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,134
Hello.

358
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,672
Hey, buddy.

359
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,808
Welcome to the party.

360
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:34,249
Let's see what kind of moves you got.
Dance, little Scrat fish!

361
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,977
Dance your coconuts off!

362
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:39,150
Happy dance.

363
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:44,825
Look at him.

364
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,428
Where's my bootie? Has anyone seen it?

365
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,191
Dude, it's right behind you.

366
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,301
Where? Where's my bootie?

367
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,937
I can't see it.

368
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,766
It's all I can see.

369
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:58,370
This is a lovely vacation.
Best I've ever had.

370
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:00,477
Morning, sunshine.

371
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:04,777
Let me be the first
to extend the hand of friendship.

372
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,307
That's your foot.

373
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,419
Nothing gets by you, does it?

374
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,750
What do you want?

375
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:14,815
I bet you're feeling lost, scared, confused.

376
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,587
Allow me to explain.

377
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,160
Help me out, boys.

378
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:21,125
Captain's going to sing a shanty!

379
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,098
<i># Here you are on a boat #
# You're adrift, you're afloat #</i>

380
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:25,796
<i># One might even say you're stuck #</i>

381
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:28,235
<i># Well, I don't want to gloat #
# But I would like to note #</i>

382
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:29,671
<i># That you're in luck #</i>

383
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,073
<i># You've been saved by the ape #
# That rules these waters #</i>

384
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,005
<i># So forget about #
# Your wives and daughters #</i>

385
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:37,304
<i># First Mate introduce me #
# to them, please #</i>

386
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,147
<i>Aye-aye, Captain Gutt.</i>

387
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:41,786
<i># He's the big and scary #
# Elegant yet hairy #</i>

388
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,887
<i># Fear-inspiring #
# Years from retiring #</i>

389
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,955
<i># Looting, stealing #
# Banana peeling #</i>

390
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:48,649
<i># Undisputed Master of the Seas #</i>

391
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:49,716
<i>Oh, jeez.</i>

392
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:50,783
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

393
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:51,851
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

394
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,919
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

395
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:53,987
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

396
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:58,863
<i># I'm a primate pirate pioneer #
# And these are my brave buccaneers #</i>

397
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:01,562
<i># All of whom were once #
# Lost souls like you #</i>

398
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,729
<i># lt's true #</i>

399
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:04,705
<i># He rescued us #
# He saved our butts #</i>

400
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,707
<i># For that we owe our lives to Gutt #</i>

401
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:08,937
<i># And assuming he doesn't kill you #</i>

402
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:11,344
<i># You will owe him, too #</i>

403
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:12,881
Kill them?

404
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:14,780
Me? No, no.

405
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:19,519
Well, at least not this
very large, useful mammoth.

406
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,090
Hey, hands off.

407
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,453
Anyway...

408
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,686
<i># Here we are on a ship #
# Moving at quite a clip #</i>

409
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:26,230
<i># Through the ever-shifting ice #</i>

410
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:27,589
<i># Come along on a trip #</i>

411
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:28,690
<i># That's a hint #
# That's a tip #</i>

412
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,756
<i># That's good advice #</i>

413
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:34,604
<i># In a world that's going under #
# To survive you must learn to plunder #</i>

414
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,900
<i># Luckily that's my field of expertise #</i>

415
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:37,997
<i># He's the best. #</i>

416
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,236
<i># He's a robbing, thieving #
# We really should be leaving. #</i>

417
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,209
<i># Weapon throwing #
# We got to get going. #</i>

418
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,371
<i># Sloth-slaying #
# Wish we could be staying. #</i>

419
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:46,210
<i># Undisputed #
# Uncontested #</i>

420
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:48,375
<i># Monkey suited #
# Yeah, you guessed it #</i>

421
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:50,987
<i># Master of the seas #</i>

422
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,080
<i>Oh, please.</i>

423
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:53,146
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

424
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:54,214
<i>- That's me
- 'Tis he</i>

425
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,281
<i># It's who? #
# It's you #</i>

426
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,384
<i>Just testing, I knew.</i>

427
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:58,725
<i># It's me #</i>

428
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,162
Good shanty, sir.

429
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:03,056
"Captain Gutt"? Really?

430
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:07,136
I have a little paunch, too,
but I wouldn't name myself after it.

431
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,903
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

432
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:13,135
But that's not how I got my name.

433
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:15,279
These got me my name.

434
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,108
- I don't get it.
- No?

435
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:18,681
Okay.

436
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,183
Let me give you a visual aid.

437
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,286
I just gently press here.

438
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:27,191
- That tickles.
- And go down like this.

439
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,488
And then your innards
become your outards.

440
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:34,192
I still don't get it.

441
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:37,633
Look, as much as I'm tempted
to join a monkey...

442
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:41,703
the Easter Bunny
and a giant bag of pudding...

443
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:43,170
l'll pass.

444
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,368
No one's going to stop me
from getting back to my family.

445
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,641
I'm going to lambada
with your liver, buddy.

446
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:50,976
Let me at him!

447
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:57,615
That family is going to be the death of you.

448
00:32:58,056 --> 00:32:59,785
First mate, jettison the deadweight.

449
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,587
Aye-aye, sir. Prepare the plank!

450
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,193
Prepare the plank!

451
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,828
Preparing the plank!

452
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,463
What?
You want me to walk into the water?

453
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:13,368
I can't because I just ate less than
20 minutes ago, and you know the rule.

454
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:14,769
That's a myth.

455
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:17,137
Okay, as long as it's safe.

456
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,611
- Wait!
- Thank goodness.

457
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,645
Dump the wench, too.

458
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:26,614
Ladies first.

459
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:28,709
Such a nice boy.

460
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:31,449
Why can't you be more like him, Sidney?

461
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,423
Granny, no! Wait!

462
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:35,853
Manny!

463
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:37,952
Get me to the vine.

464
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:40,555
Yeah, yeah, got it.

465
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,832
You all got some ugly goldfish.

466
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:50,764
Come on, a little more.

467
00:33:57,749 --> 00:33:58,773
No!

468
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,084
Extinct that mammoth.

469
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:05,486
Come on, Manny, kick his monkey butt!

470
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,090
Look at you.

471
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:10,127
Eleven tons of landlubber blubber.

472
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,959
Hey, I'm not fat! I'm poufy.

473
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:16,133
Too bad, Tubby. I could have used you.

474
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,529
Ain't going to happen, Captain.

475
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,937
I got you, Granny.

476
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:29,046
Giddy up, let's go, let's go.

477
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,550
Does anyone have floaties?

478
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:43,460
No! No!

479
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,323
My bounty!

480
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,609
They sunk our battleship.
What are we going to do?

481
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,308
We're all going to drown.

482
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:09,009
You're a sea creature, you idiot.

483
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,179
Good point, sir.

484
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,049
Should I fly the white, captain?

485
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:14,386
No!

486
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,393
Wait, what about Shira?

487
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:18,554
- What about her?
- Yeah, what about her?

488
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,531
Anyone else want to play "Captain"?

489
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:23,125
Good.

490
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:26,602
Now come on, blubber-brain. Swim.

491
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:31,764
Hey! Gutt! Flynn! Anyone there?

492
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:33,310
Here, grab hold.

493
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,373
No, go away. I'd rather drown.

494
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:37,847
Whatever the lady wants.

495
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,752
I said I didn't need your help.

496
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:48,756
You're welcome.
So, care to join our scurvy crew?

497
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:52,563
Two sloths, a mammoth and a saber?

498
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,823
You guys are like the start of a bad joke.

499
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,594
And we saved you.

500
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:58,795
That makes you the punch line, kitty.

501
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,568
Don't call me "kitty."

502
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,402
Okay, I won't...

503
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:04,932
Kitty.

504
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:06,704
If they kiss, I'm going to puke.

505
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:09,246
What? Wait, no.

506
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:27,824
Are we there yet?

507
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:32,864
I don't think we're ever going to get there.

508
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,106
Maybe we should rest for a few hours.

509
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:37,965
Thank you.

510
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,040
Night, Ellie.

511
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:52,849
I miss you, Dad.

512
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:57,127
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

513
00:36:57,395 --> 00:36:58,419
Ethan!

514
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,758
Hi.

515
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:03,831
I meant to do that.

516
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:06,493
I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.

517
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,005
What? No, this just helps me think.

518
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:13,042
It gets blood to the old noggin
and away from the old... whatever.

519
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,912
Okay, that's a little weird.

520
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:26,820
So, how are you doing, you know,
with all of this?

521
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,519
Honestly, a little scared.

522
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,992
Okay, a lot scared.

523
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,654
Everything we knew is gone.

524
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,494
Yeah, I was pretty scared, too.

525
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,401
I mean, not scared, but, like, concerned.

526
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:42,300
Do you want to walk with me tomorrow?

527
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:44,369
Try and get our minds off all this stuff.

528
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,171
You want to walk with me?

529
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,369
You did almost flatten me this morning.

530
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:51,506
So, I figure it can't
really go worse than that, right?

531
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,574
Yeah.

532
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:54,675
Just one thing.

533
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:58,210
It's totally no big deal, but
you might want to lose the molehog.

534
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:01,315
Louis? Yeah, sure, not a problem.

535
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,287
Wow.

536
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,691
Someone looks happy.

537
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,058
Ethan's great, isn't he?

538
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:14,431
Baby, I know you like this one...

539
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:18,372
but just don't let anyone change
who you are, okay?

540
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:19,908
I know.

541
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,145
You coming up?

542
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,146
I think I'm going to sleep
down here tonight.

543
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,549
Okay.

544
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:33,351
Night, baby.

545
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,122
Night, Mom.

546
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:37,990
Good night, Dad.

547
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,568
Hey, chew this sandwich for me.

548
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:57,475
Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us?

549
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:01,274
They think we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right.

550
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:05,019
It's a rat!

551
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:10,620
No! No!

552
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:14,354
- Screw up.
- Oh, Sid!

553
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,434
We'll never make it home on this thing.

554
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:21,336
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you capsized our berg, genius.

555
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:22,600
Yeah, trying to escape.

556
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:23,698
- Wimp!
- Whiner!

557
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:24,799
- Crybaby!
- Land!

558
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,434
Yeah, land! Wait, what?

559
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:27,842
Not her. There!

560
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,113
Land!

561
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,314
Everyone paddle. Paddle!

562
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,005
Food! I missed you so much!

563
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,978
Look at me, I've wasted away.

564
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:14,521
Okay, snack time is over.
We got to build a raft.

565
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Manny.

566
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,957
Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.

567
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:20,892
Go get her. She can help us get back.

568
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:21,989
Shira!

569
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:47,281
Gotcha!

570
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:50,186
Whoa!

571
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,858
Let go of me.

572
00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:59,800
Where do you think you're going?

573
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,063
Whoa!

574
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,672
Switchback Cove.

575
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:06,466
It's the way home.

576
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:08,605
Oh, no.

577
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,842
You call this a ship you miserable runts?

578
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,850
Yeah, you little runts. Get to work.

579
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:17,513
Faster, you worthless, wormy
sons of sorry excuses...

580
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,180
for shark bait weevils!

581
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:20,747
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

582
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:24,185
Now get this chunk of ice
seaworthy by sundown...

583
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,696
or I will keelhaul the lot of you!

584
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,457
So what do you think?

585
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:33,396
Two words, anger management.

586
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:35,634
I'm talking about the current.

587
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:38,197
Diego's right. We found the way home.

588
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:43,043
Yeah, that's great.
Too bad we don't have a ship.

589
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:46,641
Sure we do. It's right there.

590
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:48,810
Well, that's a flawless plan.

591
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,222
You want to pirate a pirate ship
from pirates.

592
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,082
It pains me to say this, but...

593
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:55,921
- our prisoner has a point.
- Yeah, well...

594
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:59,861
Guys. The trees have ears.

595
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,074
Wait a minute,
maybe we can help each other.

596
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,446
Hey, little fellas. Hey, come on out.

597
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:27,424
No, no, it's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

598
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:32,157
How about you and us
against the pirates, huh?

599
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:36,461
You got no idea what I'm saying, do you?

600
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:40,126
Okay, ship, me want.

601
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:42,238
Yeah, nice try Jungle Jim.

602
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,340
Go ahead make fun. He got it.

603
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,178
Thank you.

604
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:52,509
May I try?

605
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,845
Yeah, knock yourself out.

606
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:57,081
Okay, watch this.

607
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,124
Sick sloths sip broth,
sick sloths sip broth.

608
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,369
Ta-da!

609
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:25,639
That, they got?

610
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,288
Yup, they're in.

611
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,022
Great, we'll free your buddies
and we can all work together...

612
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:40,825
to kick a little pirate booty.

613
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,514
Easy, kitty. Water.

614
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,652
You need it.

615
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:08,082
I don't need anything from you.

616
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,855
Fine, die of thirst.
That will really show me.

617
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:12,190
Wait.

618
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,057
I'll take it.

619
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:15,290
Thank you.

620
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:19,229
You have a way of saying "thank you"
that makes it sound like "drop dead."

621
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:21,166
It's a gift.

622
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:23,570
Well, you're pretty soft, for a saber.

623
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,632
Excuse me, I am not soft.

624
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,610
I happen to be a remorseless assassin.

625
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,339
Diego-poo!

626
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:31,278
Hey, I made you another coral necklace.

627
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:33,180
He keeps losing them.

628
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,917
Yeah, I think I'm starting to get
why you're not in a pack.

629
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,151
Listen, I chose to leave my pack, all right?

630
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:43,591
Congratulations, warrior princess.

631
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:44,685
So did I.

632
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,587
- Really?
- What?

633
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:49,360
Nothing, I just know how hard that is...

634
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,162
walking away from everything you know.

635
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,338
Oh, great, are we going to
braid each other's fur now?

636
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,202
Funny. Really funny.

637
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:57,934
Can I tell you the difference
between you and me?

638
00:44:58,009 --> 00:44:59,772
I wouldn't still be wearing that necklace?

639
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:03,640
No, we both
might have wanted out of pack life...

640
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:06,148
but at least I didn't trade
one pack for another.

641
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,775
I got something more.

642
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,581
Oh, yeah, what's that?

643
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:12,089
- A herd.
- What's the difference?

644
00:45:12,256 --> 00:45:13,553
We have each other's backs.

645
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:16,149
Gutt has my back. I'm his first mate.

646
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:19,162
Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you.

647
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,367
You know, you won't beat him.

648
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,698
Your big furry friend over there?

649
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,499
He has no idea what he's up against.

650
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,596
Yeah, but neither does Gutt.

651
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,575
Unwind the binds,
don't let go until we're all on board.

652
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:36,636
Okay, we need precision timing
from everyone to get that ship.

653
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,205
Half-pint, you got your end covered, right?

654
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,750
I'm going to take that as a "yes." Diego?

655
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,456
I'll free his little friends.

656
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:48,514
Sid and Granny?

657
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,387
Untie the ship, sir!

658
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:54,022
Right, unwind the vines,
and don't let go until we're all on board.

659
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:56,066
We're relying on you, Sid. You got that?

660
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:57,930
Yes, sir. Totally focused, sir.

661
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,060
Don't worry.

662
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:02,936
It'll be easy since
we don't have to guard Shira anymore.

663
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:08,471
We need to move, now.

664
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,604
Squint, batten down the hatches.

665
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,410
Raz, hoist the anchor.

666
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:14,644
And, Gupta, fly the colors.

667
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:16,413
Of course, Captain.

668
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:19,354
We're setting sail for vengeance, lads.

669
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:21,481
I love vengeance.

670
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:23,283
Captain!

671
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,727
Shira! Oh, what a relief!

672
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:28,230
I thought we'd lost you.

673
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:30,358
The mammoth. He washed ashore with me.

674
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:32,197
What? He's here?

675
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:36,733
Did you sink your fangs into him?
Did he beg for his life?

676
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,866
No, the saber took me down.

677
00:46:39,877 --> 00:46:41,811
You're a failure.

678
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:47,077
I need warriors, and all I have
are kitty cats and bunny rabbits.

679
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,682
And a seal and a kangaroo.

680
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:54,781
You take the saber down, or you die trying.

681
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,894
No excuses.

682
00:46:58,062 --> 00:46:59,723
Yes, Captain.

683
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:00,821
Mr. Squint.

684
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:01,922
Aye, sir.

685
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,260
You're first mate now.

686
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:07,263
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of
cool with me, Captain.

687
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:10,136
Out of my way, saber.
You answer to me now.

688
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:12,141
Gutt, listen, he's coming for the...

689
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:50,641
Grab your weapons, mates!

690
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:56,447
Not the spoon, Flynn.

691
00:47:58,055 --> 00:47:59,147
Follow me!

692
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:00,451
Yeah, let's do this.

693
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,292
Let me at him! Yeah!

694
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,733
Guys, that's not necessary, really.

695
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:15,633
I love you, too, yeah.

696
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:19,071
Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up.

697
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:21,302
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

698
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:23,275
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

699
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:24,436
Unwind the vines.

700
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:26,550
Don't let... Oh, yummo!

701
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,911
Sid, no! It's a lotus berry.

702
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:33,386
It will paralyze you.

703
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:35,925
Oh, please. I know my berries.

704
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:37,417
Don't...

705
00:48:37,494 --> 00:48:38,518
swallow.

706
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:42,498
See, I'm fine.
If there's one thing I know, it's berries.

707
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:45,926
Uh-oh!

708
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:17,866
Yeah, finally!

709
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,871
Who's the Easter Bunny now?

710
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:30,780
- It worked, he bought it!
- Come on!

711
00:49:30,848 --> 00:49:31,906
No, no!

712
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,478
It's been a diversion.

713
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,575
I know, I'm having a blast.

714
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:39,089
No, pinhead, they're stealing my ship.

715
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:46,329
One thing, Sid. You couldn't do one thing?

716
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:48,092
Look at you.

717
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:49,289
Sid, can you hear me?

718
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:50,390
Bye-bye.

719
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,162
Say something, buddy.

720
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:54,895
Let's get them!

721
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:56,470
Let's go.

722
00:49:58,876 --> 00:49:59,934
The ship!

723
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,002
Come on, we've got to catch it
before it hits open water!

724
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:09,648
Sorry. All right, l'll hold you higher.

725
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,287
Sorry. Sorry.

726
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:15,589
Say adieu, mammoth!

727
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,049
Adieu!

728
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:18,151
Sorry, buddy.

729
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:29,005
I'm coming, Sid.

730
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,571
I got you! I got you! I got you!

731
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:47,516
I'm coming for you, mammoth.

732
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:02,599
Diego!

733
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:03,930
Come on!

734
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:08,706
Come on, move it!

735
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:21,582
Why are you doing this?

736
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:24,422
You don't understand. I don't have a choice.

737
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:26,156
You don't have to live this way, Shira.

738
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,595
You'll be safe with us.

739
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:29,723
- We take care of each other.
- Diego!

740
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:32,968
I can't hold on much longer.

741
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:34,863
Diego!

742
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:36,405
Come with us.

743
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:37,770
Come with me.

744
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:51,212
What are you doing?

745
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:52,619
I've got your back.

746
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:20,606
So long, banana breath.
Thanks for the ship!

747
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:47,140
Oh, no, he's gone forever!

748
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:50,107
Oh! There he is.

749
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:00,780
Shore leave is over.

750
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:04,123
Get your sorry carcasses on board now.

751
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:17,129
Gutt, I can explain.

752
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:19,002
When this ends...

753
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:22,341
l'll have a tiger's skin hanging on my wall.

754
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:26,072
I don't care whose.

755
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,485
That mammoth has taken my ship...

756
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:32,886
my bounty...

757
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:35,823
and now the loyalty of my crew.

758
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:38,860
I will destroy him...

759
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,759
and everything he loves.

760
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:28,434
Wait for it. Wait for it.

761
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:40,116
That was awesome.

762
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,214
Can I ask you guys something?

763
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,559
How are you both so happy?

764
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:45,686
Doesn't it weigh on you
that the world might be ending?

765
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:47,556
Can I tell him our secret?

766
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:50,556
Come here. Come here.

767
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:54,730
We're very, very stupid.

768
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:01,876
But, still, you're not a teensy bit
concerned about...

769
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:04,573
I don't know, say, imminent death?

770
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,614
Beep.

771
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:10,112
I'm going to go find Peaches.

772
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:17,423
Guys, over here. Come on, it's a shortcut.

773
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:18,927
You're going to love this.

774
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:21,328
Come on, girls, let's have some fun.

775
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:22,422
Wow!

776
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,499
- This is so cool.
- It's like we're upside down.

777
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:27,400
That is amazing.

778
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:29,064
Echo!

779
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:37,344
Too bad your molehog friend
isn't here, huh?

780
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:38,972
You're not really friends with him, are you?

781
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:40,914
Yeah, come clean, Peaches.

782
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,248
Are you friends
with that awkward little rodent or not?

783
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:44,811
I mean...

784
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,550
Louis and I, we've hung out or whatever.

785
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:51,188
But, no, we're not really friends-friends.

786
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:52,353
Not friends?

787
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,855
Louis! I...

788
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:57,466
Busted.

789
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,234
Good to know.

790
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:04,705
Louis, wait.

791
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:08,872
He even runs away like a loser.

792
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:12,642
Whoa, Peaches, don't stress.
You're with us now.

793
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:15,310
Yeah, stress is so stressful.

794
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:18,980
Yeah, girl, if you're going to stress
about something, stress about your hair.

795
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:22,719
I know, right?
This humidity, I can't stand it.

796
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:28,423
Guys, we should get out of here.

797
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:30,489
Are you kidding? This is epic!

798
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:34,234
Go! Go! Go!

799
00:56:40,177 --> 00:56:41,576
Yeah!

800
00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,210
How sick was that?

801
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:46,314
Yo, that was insane.

802
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:49,350
Hey, Peach, loosen up! Have some fun.

803
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:52,582
Fun, you call that fun? I'm out of here.

804
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:54,988
Come on, do you really want to go back...

805
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:58,994
to hanging with a weird molehog freak
and give all of this up?

806
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:01,326
I mean, it's bad enough
that your family is half possum and...

807
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:02,456
Bad enough?

808
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:05,931
There is nothing bad
about being part of my family.

809
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,333
I like hanging by my tail.

810
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:11,701
And if you geniuses are normal,
this species is going to end up extinct.

811
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:15,406
Yeah, well, your species
is going to be extinct first.

812
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:17,137
Burn!

813
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:19,307
We're the same species, genius.

814
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:21,942
What? Double burn.

815
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:43,899
Hey, I can wiggle my toe again.

816
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:47,375
The important one,
the little piggy who went to market.

817
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:49,571
Wait! I'm talking again.

818
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:53,207
I had so many things
trapped inside of me that I couldn't say.

819
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:56,378
Like, "Hey, I'm not dead!"

820
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:58,816
And, "Why does a hurricane
have an eye but not an ear?"

821
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:02,755
I'll push him overboard.
You guys say it was an accident.

822
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:05,656
I'm in. How about you, Diego? Diego?

823
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:07,923
Hey, relax, buddy!

824
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:11,191
Captain Crazy
and his floating petting zoo are history.

825
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:14,135
Come on! We're finally heading home!

826
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:15,330
I don't know what's wrong with me.

827
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:18,238
I can't eat, can't sleep.
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

828
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:22,077
I know what you've got.

829
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,544
The L word.

830
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:25,410
Yeah, leprosy.

831
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:28,383
No, Sid, it's four letters.

832
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:30,919
It starts with "L," ends with "E."

833
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:32,846
Lice!

834
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:36,359
No, Diego, my friend, is in love.

835
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:38,951
Oh, yeah! Love.

836
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:41,454
You mean with the pirate? No.

837
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:44,862
Shira's gotten under your skin.
Come on, admit it.

838
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:47,096
A rugged saber like you.

839
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:49,866
A more rugged saber like her.

840
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,773
No, no, no. You guys are dead wrong.

841
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:58,472
Denial is the clincher.
You're in love, pussy cat!

842
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:01,108
Diego and Shira
Sitting in a tree

843
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:03,550
K - l - S - S - l - N - G

844
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,679
Real mature, guys. Real mature.

845
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:08,723
Then comes marriage
Then comes a baby in the baby carriage

846
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:10,257
Sucking his thumb...

847
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:14,759
Diego.

848
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:22,396
Diego.

849
00:59:22,706 --> 00:59:24,071
Shira?

850
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:26,874
I wanted to come with you.

851
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,480
She's beautiful.

852
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:33,140
Sid...

853
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:37,414
I adore a sloth who cares
nothing about personal hygiene.

854
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:39,114
That's me, baby.

855
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:41,646
Granny.

856
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:44,057
Come to me, Granny.

857
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:48,292
Well, hello.

858
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:53,032
The wrinklier the raisin,
the sweeter the fruit.

859
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,695
Granny likey.

860
00:59:54,771 --> 00:59:56,898
Granny likey very much.

861
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:03,039
- Guys, aren't you paying attention?
- Manny...

862
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:05,377
- Manny, are you there?
- Ellie?

863
01:00:05,448 --> 01:00:07,348
We're over here, Manny.

864
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:08,941
This way, Daddy.

865
01:00:09,052 --> 01:00:11,282
I really need you.

866
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:13,579
I know, honey. Stay there.

867
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:16,916
I'm coming.

868
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:20,087
You were right, Manny.
You're always right.

869
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:21,887
No, look, I was...

870
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:24,727
Wait a minute. Ellie would never say that.

871
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,928
Manny? Manny.

872
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:30,197
No, they're not real. They're monsters!

873
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:32,298
They're sirens. Don't listen to them!

874
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:36,937
Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew

875
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:41,774
No! They may look real, but they're not.

876
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,714
They're going to destroy the ship.

877
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:47,356
Come on, tiger. Swim with me.

878
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:50,582
Sid...

879
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,160
I have a snack for you.

880
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:57,559
And she cooks, too.

881
01:00:58,702 --> 01:00:59,691
Sid, no!

882
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:17,513
Why are we kissing?

883
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:19,714
Because cruises are romantic?

884
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,585
Five more seconds
and we'd have been goners.

885
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:26,552
Call me.

886
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:37,860
Here, girl.

887
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:41,568
Here, Precious.

888
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:44,102
She thinks she finally found her pet.

889
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,275
Good girl. Here you go.

890
01:02:47,343 --> 01:02:51,336
Granny, can't you throw imaginary food
to your imaginary pet?

891
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,384
Enough already.

892
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:56,952
We need to keep a lookout for home.

893
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:59,378
Ignore them, Precious.

894
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:00,787
I do.

895
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:12,661
You can't take your eyes off her
for one minute.

896
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:14,327
Nope, it's like having a child.

897
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:17,830
Only without any of the joy.

898
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:19,238
Hey, brain trust...

899
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:20,636
brace for impact.

900
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:27,142
Guys, look.

901
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:28,710
We're almost home!

902
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,151
- Buddy, I never doubted you.
- Me either.

903
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:35,985
Except for the six or seven times
I thought we were going to die.

904
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,405
What's wrong, sweetheart?

905
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,909
You ever say something
you knew you couldn't take back?

906
01:03:54,978 --> 01:03:56,377
Is this about Louis?

907
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:58,175
I messed up so bad, Mom.

908
01:03:58,248 --> 01:04:00,011
It's okay. It happens.

909
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:04,116
Cute boys can whiplash your brain.
No doubt about that.

910
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:06,052
But Ethan was the wrong guy.

911
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:07,248
And you figured it out.

912
01:04:07,724 --> 01:04:09,419
You'll know what to say to Louis.

913
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:17,092
What's going on?

914
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:24,262
The land bridge.

915
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:26,640
It's gone.

916
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,344
We're trapped!

917
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,777
But we were supposed to meet Dad here.
What are we going to do?

918
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,357
Ellie!

919
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:53,628
Peaches!

920
01:04:57,473 --> 01:04:59,600
Oh, no. The land bridge.

921
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:01,109
But if it's gone...

922
01:05:01,211 --> 01:05:02,269
- how are we going to...
- Sid!

923
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:04,404
No, they have to be on the other side.

924
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,607
Manny, there is no other side.

925
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:07,741
They have to be here.

926
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:08,841
Ellie!

927
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:11,353
Peaches!

928
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:13,352
I'm here!

929
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,416
Please...

930
01:05:16,526 --> 01:05:18,323
she's got to be here.

931
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:28,898
Dad!

932
01:05:28,972 --> 01:05:30,496
- Wait, did you hear that?
- Manny...

933
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:32,700
No, I heard something. I heard it!

934
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:38,170
- Is that?
- Peaches? There she is!

935
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:39,739
Dad!

936
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,148
We're coming, sweetie. Don't move!

937
01:05:42,285 --> 01:05:43,309
Daddy!

938
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:44,512
Peaches!

939
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:47,451
Welcome home, Daddy.

940
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:48,581
Let go of me.

941
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:50,589
What are the odds?

942
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:53,421
We were just talking about you.

943
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:58,567
You like the new ship?
I call her Sweet Revenge.

944
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:03,898
And look here. We've got the catch du jour.

945
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,464
Ellie.

946
01:06:05,642 --> 01:06:07,371
I'm all right.

947
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:08,910
Let my daughter go.

948
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:10,703
It's okay.

949
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,644
He wants me. And he's going to get me.

950
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:22,681
Sacrificing yourself for your daughter.
How touching.

951
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:24,488
How predictable.

952
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,289
Now come and get her.

953
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:34,226
Good day, mate.

954
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:35,601
You remember us?

955
01:06:35,672 --> 01:06:37,071
We're the bad guys.

956
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,674
All right, let them go.

957
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,301
I don't think so.

958
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:45,040
You destroyed everything I had.

959
01:06:45,114 --> 01:06:47,514
I'm just returning the favor.

960
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:49,049
No!

961
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:53,178
I warned you.

962
01:06:53,256 --> 01:06:54,348
Stop!

963
01:06:57,093 --> 01:06:59,721
Let the mammoth go!

964
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:01,494
Weiner?

965
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:04,623
Who brought the muscle to the party?

966
01:07:04,701 --> 01:07:05,759
Louis, don't!

967
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:08,468
What's he doing?
He's going to get himself killed.

968
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:10,472
It's okay, I can handle him.

969
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,566
How cute, a hero.

970
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:15,838
Let's see what bravery gets you.

971
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:18,407
Gupta, give the lad your weapon.

972
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:20,775
Nice knowing you, kid.

973
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:35,361
Let's dance, hero.

974
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:56,643
Don't stand there like barnacles. Get him!

975
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:00,652
Oi, going somewhere, mate?

976
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:07,960
Let me at him.

977
01:08:12,735 --> 01:08:14,430
Any last words?

978
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:16,871
Precious!

979
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:19,066
Will you stop with the "Precious"?

980
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:23,740
Mummy.

981
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:28,743
Well, I guess we showed them, huh?

982
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:31,116
- Precious!
- That's your pet?

983
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:37,289
Maybe that crazy old bat
isn't that crazy after all.

984
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:41,526
Nope, she's nuts.

985
01:08:41,597 --> 01:08:45,089
You waiting for a formal invitation,
fancy pants?

986
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:46,226
Get in.

987
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:48,065
I'm going to regret this.

988
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:51,871
Bombs away!

989
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:00,477
Don't be a scaredy cat.

990
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:09,718
This smells worse than me.

991
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:13,091
Precious, set your flippers
45 degrees north.

992
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:14,957
Granny's done running.

993
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:16,055
Back off.

994
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:17,963
It's okay, I'm on your side.

995
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:20,800
I knew you were a traitor.

996
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:25,100
Your little bunny nose wiggles
in the cutest way when you're mad.

997
01:09:25,174 --> 01:09:26,505
What?

998
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:28,641
Your nine lives are over, kitty.

999
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:29,837
Silly rabbit...

1000
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:31,470
piracy doesn't pay.

1001
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,538
Hey, that's not cool. Come on, now.

1002
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:41,981
Anyone have a body wipe?

1003
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:44,925
Suck it up, buttercup. How's it looking?

1004
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:49,062
Not good, Granny sir.

1005
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:51,193
Full speed ahead!

1006
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:53,230
Dive, dive, dive!

1007
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,041
Fire!

1008
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:06,206
Booyah, baby!

1009
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:12,051
This feels so good!

1010
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:13,611
Thank you, Mister Whale.

1011
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:16,283
- Hi, Manny.
- Sid!

1012
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:17,519
Help!

1013
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:21,757
Mom!

1014
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:25,295
No, Peaches, l'll get your mother.
You stay there.

1015
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:26,733
Hurry, Manny.

1016
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,869
Payback time.

1017
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:34,069
Manny!

1018
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:36,407
- Ellie!
- I got this, Dad.

1019
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:38,970
Peaches, no! It's too dangerous!

1020
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:40,982
Not if you're half-possum!

1021
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:58,398
She did it.

1022
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:01,135
My daughter's all grown up.

1023
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:07,706
That's my girl.

1024
01:11:10,913 --> 01:11:12,471
We need to get out of here.

1025
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:14,072
Go, go, I'm right behind you.

1026
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,242
No!

1027
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:17,183
I'm right behind you.

1028
01:11:17,787 --> 01:11:18,947
Dad!

1029
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,954
No!

1030
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:33,766
There's nowhere to run, Manny.

1031
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:49,080
You know, this ocean
isn't big enough for the both of us.

1032
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:50,911
Don't worry...

1033
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:54,252
you won't take up much space
once I flatten you.

1034
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:09,097
I told you, tubby...

1035
01:12:09,338 --> 01:12:12,364
you shouldn't have messed
with the Master of the Seas.

1036
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:17,143
You know, sometimes,
it pays to weigh eleven tons!

1037
01:12:17,446 --> 01:12:18,470
No!

1038
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:21,116
Bon voyage, monkey boy!

1039
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:32,322
Did somebody hail a whale?

1040
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:39,496
So, you must be Precious.

1041
01:12:40,503 --> 01:12:42,334
Mission accomplished, Granny.

1042
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:45,767
Who says old ladies can't drive?

1043
01:12:56,318 --> 01:13:00,345
Oh, Captain Gutt!

1044
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,855
That's me!

1045
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:05,750
Let's rule the seas together.

1046
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:07,529
Aye, aye.

1047
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:22,668
Dad!

1048
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:26,278
How's that for an entrance?

1049
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:33,254
Dad!

1050
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,623
Manny.

1051
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:41,088
I told you
your father would never give up on us.

1052
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:42,994
Never.

1053
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,959
Hey, I actually...

1054
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:52,638
You know, Sid...

1055
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,266
you're not such a screw-up.

1056
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:56,436
- Really?
- Really.

1057
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:58,209
You're a hero.

1058
01:13:59,715 --> 01:14:00,977
You too, Granny.

1059
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:02,707
Thanks, lady.

1060
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:05,481
So, still want me
on your scurvy crew?

1061
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:08,022
You bet.
Welcome to our herd.

1062
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:11,692
Hey, you.

1063
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:15,190
I can't believe you did that for me.

1064
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:16,424
Thank you.

1065
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:19,064
Someone once told me,
no matter what...

1066
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:20,898
you never leave a friend behind.

1067
01:14:22,338 --> 01:14:25,307
All this sweetness
is going to rot my teeth.

1068
01:14:25,374 --> 01:14:26,398
If I had any.

1069
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:33,873
Our home is gone.

1070
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:35,610
Where do we go now?

1071
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:53,795
Momma loves you, too!

1072
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:30,665
- I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah.

1073
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:32,172
- Excuse me?
- Dad!

1074
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:35,969
When you two get off this ship,
I expect you both to...

1075
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:37,069
have fun.

1076
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:39,475
You're a brave kid, Weiner.

1077
01:15:39,548 --> 01:15:40,810
Wait, what?

1078
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:44,317
You heard me.
You two should go out and explore.

1079
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,287
Go where the day takes you.

1080
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:48,779
But be back before sunset.

1081
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:51,918
An hour after sunset?

1082
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:53,188
Yeah, not a minute later.

1083
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:54,889
Deal.

1084
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:56,989
I love you, Dad.

1085
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:04,062
Okay if we hang with you guys?

1086
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:05,231
Sure.

1087
01:16:05,307 --> 01:16:06,899
I always liked him.

1088
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:10,309
Louis the hero.
Brave-a-licious.

1089
01:16:12,014 --> 01:16:13,743
She's not my little girl anymore.

1090
01:16:13,816 --> 01:16:15,784
And you're both going to be just fine.

1091
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,145
I know.

1092
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:22,984
You know, Sidney?
You've got yourself a nice family, here.

1093
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:25,287
A real family.

1094
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:27,989
Yeah, I'm pretty lucky.

1095
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:29,928
Here, chew this kiwi for me.

1096
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:32,059
Never again.

1097
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:33,862
Ta-da!

1098
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:44,310
- Hey, sailor.
- Whoa!

1099
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,709
Welcome, brother.

1100
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:31,523
Behold, Scratlantis.

1101
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:30,910
No!

1102
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,644
Stop!

1103
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:37,317
Brother, rise above this base desire.

1104
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:39,691
Be more than a rodent.

1105
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:30,241

1128
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:24,331

1129
